# GeExtension-Stylus-themes
Download the "Stylus" Chrome extension and the .json from my GitHub.
Once Stylus is installed click your extensions tab and choose Stylus.
On the Stylus page, choose "import" and select the dark mode .json you downloaded.
Make sure you enable the checkmark once added to Stylus and it should be working.

KEEP THE CREDITS, WORK WAS PUT INTO THIS. Thanks :)
